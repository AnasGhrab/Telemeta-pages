Telemeta : Web Audio Content Management System
===================================================

`Telemeta <http://telemeta.org>`_ is an open source web audio archiving program which introduces useful and secure methods to backup, index, transcode, analyse and publish any digitalized audio file with its metadata. It is dedicated to professionnals who wants to easily backup and publish documented sounds from collections of LP and EP vinyls, magnetic tapes or audio CDs over a strong database, in accordance with open standards.

Key features of Telemeta:
    
* Secure archiving, editing and publishing of audio files over internet.
* User friendly web frontend including user playlist management and high level search methods
* Smart dynamic and skinnable audio player (thanks to `TimeSide <http://code.google.com/p/timeside/>`_)
* "On the fly" analyzing, transcoding and metadata embedding based on an easy plugin architecture
* Multi-format support : FLAC, OGG, MP3, WAV and more
* GEO Navigator for audio geolocalization
* DublinCore compatibility
* OAI-PMH data provider
* XML serialized backup
* SQL or Oracle backend

The Telemeta data model is now based on *collection* and *item* elements. A *collection* is described by its metadata and is related to audio *items*. An *item* embeds audio files with its metadata. This model has been designed to fit the one of the French Centre of Etnomusicology (CREM) of the University of Paris 10 but could be easily adapted or overrided to suit other data structures.
