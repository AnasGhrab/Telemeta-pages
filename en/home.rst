The National Sound Archive, a space dedicated to  memory
========================================================

The establishment of the Tunisian National Sound Archives (TNSA) dates back to the end of 1994 (Decree No. 94-2137 of 10 October 1994). Unlike other experiences around the world, where  sound archives are attached to national libraries, the TNSA was created as a sub-department of the Center for Arab  and Mediterranean Music. It is located in  the building known as the Belvedere, formerly al-Qubba al-Bīḍā (the white cupola) , one of the ancilary buildings of the Ennejma Ezzahra palace.
The TNSA provides the CAMM with an essential dimension which is the protection of the phonographic heritage. Indeed, this department pursues several missions aimed at preserving this heritage: collection, cataloguing and restoration of audio recordings and above all, protection and conservation by means of the phonographic legal deposit. 
 
With the TNSA, devoted to memory, the Centre for Arab and Mediterranean Music fulfils one of its fundamental objectives and acts as a polyvalent institution working through a multidisciplinary approach for the promotion of music

Missions
========

As defined in the statutes of the CAMM, the TNSA's mission is to collect, process, conserve, restore, enhance and disseminate the entire Tunisian phonographic heritage.
Its holdings are constituted through various means: legal deposit of phonograms,  field collecting , transfer of external holdings , exchange and purchase.

The legal deposit
=================

Since its creation, the TNSA has been designated as the public body which  receives and manages the legal deposit of phonograms. This function was reaffirmed by the latest update to the legal deposit legislation. The implementation of the last version of this law is awaiting the publication of a ministerial decision specifying the practical modalities.

Field collecting
================

The objective sought by the field collecting campaigns undertaking by the TNSA and affiliated  field collectors,  is the setting up  of a of recordings collection of the Tunisian musical traditions, for safeguarding  and research purposes. Collecting  also concerns musical instruments

The TNSA also seeks to recover, as far as possible, the phonographic holdings held by national institutions (Tunisian Radio Television Corporation) or foreign phonographic preservation facilities. The same approach is adopted with private collectors.

The exchange of original documents or simple copies helps fill  any gaps in our collections. The policy of exchange  thus complements the range of instruments and means feeding the  phonographic collection of the TNSA.

The sound collections
=====================

The TNSA collections feature  more than 30,000 audio and audiovisual documents, the oldest of which dates back to the year 1900, classified according to the nature of the medium .

The collection includes commercial discs, tapes, and rare or unpublished recordings. 

In order to make reading of these documents easier, the TNSA has a set up a collection  of phonographs and other reading devices intended both for reading records (78 rpms) dating back to the first half of the twentieth century. The NT also holds a considerable amount of printed material relating to the Center's recordings and musical events (pamphlets, booklets, pictures, posters). A large part of these paper documents has been digitized and is accessible on the electronic interface http://phonotheque.cmam.tn/.

* The TNSA encourages collectors and the general public to help enrich its holdings  through donations .

Digitization of holdings
========================

Since 2009, the TNSA has launched a campaign aimed at digitizing  its recordings collections as well as documents related to the recordings (Photo, brochure, pamphlet and poster).

Through donations, exchange agreements, collaborative fieldwork projects and purchase, the collection of published and unpublished recordings and books continues to grow. It provides a rich resource, unique in Britain, for scholars, musicians, media producers and general music enthusiasts. - See more at: https://www.bl.uk/collection-guides/world-and-traditional-music#sthash.DB2JxlLC.dpuf

The collection was for a good ten years managed by a DBMS( developped by Minisis, Canada;  in 2015 a major project was launched for the development of a web interface on Telemeta to allow public  access to the holdings  (Access the online database)
